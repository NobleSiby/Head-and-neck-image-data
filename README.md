# Head-and-neck-image-data

Dataset: https://wiki.cancerimagingarchive.net/plugins/servlet/mobile?contentId=11829589#content/view/11829589

Aim:
To identify subjects who are at the risk of recurrence of head and neck squamous cell carcinomas (HNSCCs) after going through the treatment using machine learning algorithms and predict the accuracy of the models.

Objectives
●	To analyze and understand the data using machine learning algorithms.
●	To perform the data pre-processing techniques.
●	To understand and detect HNSCCs using machine learning techniques.
●	To implement techniques such as Convolutional Neural Networks, Random Forest algorithm, and others, and to predict whether the subject is at the risk of recurrence of HNSCCs or not.
●	To compare the testing accuracies of the different models.

Research Questions
●	Which are the existing methods that are used for predicting HNSCCs in the early stage?
●	Are algorithms such as random forest, Convolutional neural networks providing good and speed accuracy?
●	Which feature or what impacts more on the prediction of recurrence of HNSCCs?

Introduction
In recent times, most of the people who are getting infected by cancer are getting the best possible treatment that is available in the world. However, in some cases, the patients encounter recurrence of cancer symptoms even after obtaining the best treatment. This type of scenario is considered as relapse or recurrence of cancer in medical terminology. Such scenarios need a careful study of the cancer patients who underwent the treatment for cancer and are undergoing treatment for relapse to identify the reasons for relapse of cancer. Squamous cell carcinoma is a type of cancer that can occur in the cells that line the mucosal surfaces of the neck and head region of the human body which include the mouth, throat, nose. It is known that most of the HNSCCs are derived from the mucosal epithelium in the oral cavity, larynx, and the cancers in these regions of the human body is associated with consumption of the alcohol and tobacco, and cancer in the pharynx region is because of human papillomavirus (HPV-16) (Johnson. D et al, 2020). For this study, the details of the subject with cases of Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma are taken and fed into different machine learning algorithms and select the best algorithm that can identify if the subject is at the risk of relapse of cancer in the head and neck region. This approach can help to identify the early indications of cancer relapse in patients and help physicians diagnose the relapse accurately.

Methodology:
In this work, two machine learning models are being implemented on the data to build a model that will be able to predict the relapse of cancer in the head and neck region (HNSCC). To build the proposed model, Random Forests and Convolutional Neural Networks will be used and analyzed and obtain scientifically valid results. These two algorithms are being implemented as they are best suited for the purpose of classification when compared to other machine learning algorithms (Diamant et al. 2019).
